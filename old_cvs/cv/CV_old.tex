\section*{Relevant Experience}
\subsection*{Research Experience}
\years{06/07-01/08}\textbf{Masters Thesis: Metamorphic Development beneath the Mesohellenic Ophiolite
This project involved studying the metamorphic sole beneath the Vourinos and Pindos Complexes in Northern Greece.}\\
Its primary aim was to discover the mechanisms of sole formation, and thus obduction and emplacement of the
Mesohellenic Ophiolite. The project allowed me to gain further experience in fieldwork and sampling. Further to this, I
developed skills including: thin section preparation, petrographic analysis, electron probe microscopy, conventional
thermobarometry, THERMOCALC thermobarometry and pseudosection construction. The project concluded with the
development of a novel mechanism for emplacement of the Mesohellenic Ophiolite.\\
I obtained a high First (80\%) for this project.\\
\emph{Advisor: Dr. Timothy Holland, Cambridge University.}\\
\years{06/06-01/07}\textbf{Independent mapping project and industrial work experience: Vourinos, Northern Greece.}\\
I was part of an international team of researchers studying areas of the Vourinos Ophiolite due to be flooded in 2009.
My studies concentrated on 1:5000 scale mapping of the structural geology at the base of the Vourinos Ophiolite,
particularly within the underlying tectonic m\a'{e}lange.\\
I obtained the top First in the year for this project (80\%).\\
Advisors: Dr. Alan Smith, Cambridge University.\\
\emph{Dr. Anne Rassios, Greek Institute of Geology and Mineral Exploration (IGME).}
\years{07/05-08/05}\textbf{VW, Tellus Project (British Geological Survey), Northern Ireland.}\\
This paid research appointment involved soil and stream sampling and record keeping, plus field mineralogical and
geological identification, for part of a national environmental survey completed in 2006.\\
\emph{Advisors: Louise Ander, Sean Quigley, Sophia Passmore (British Geological Survey).}
